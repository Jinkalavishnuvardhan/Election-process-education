## About

### 🗳️ What is ElectS?  
ElectS is an **advanced online voting system** built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** that aims to revolutionize the way elections are conducted. It introduces a **secure, transparent, and user-friendly digital election platform**, eliminating traditional challenges such as **fraud, high costs, manual inefficiencies, and accessibility barriers**.  

With **Advanced facial recognition**, ElectS ensures **voter identity verification**, preventing unauthorized access and multiple votes from the same user. This technology enhances security while maintaining a seamless voting experience for all users.  

### 🔴 Problems in Traditional Voting Systems
1. **Lack of Transparency** – Traditional elections often suffer from fraud, tampering, and lack of public trust.  
2. **High Costs** – Printing ballots, hiring officials, and setting up polling stations demand a significant budget.  
3. **Limited Accessibility** – Voters may struggle to reach polling stations due to distance, disabilities, or other constraints.  
4. **Manual Counting Errors** – Human errors in vote counting can lead to disputes and inaccuracies.  
5. **Security Risks** – Paper-based elections are vulnerable to tampering, while online systems may lack robust authentication.

## Installation  

ElectS is a **MERN-stack-based voting system**, and setting it up requires installing both the **frontend and backend** properly. Follow this step-by-step guide to get started.  

---

### ✅ **Prerequisites**  
Before installation, ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
🔹 **Node.js** (LTS version) – [Download & Install](https://nodejs.org/)  
🔹 **MongoDB** (Community Edition) – [Download & Install](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)  
🔹 **Git** – [Download & Install](https://git-scm.com/)  
🔹 A **code editor** (Recommended: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))  

---

## 🔹 **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LayuruLK/ElectS---Advanced-E-Voting-System.git
```
Navigate to the project folder:  
```bash
cd ElectS---Advanced-E-Voting-System
```

---

## 🔹 **Step 2: Setup the Backend (Server)**
1️⃣ Move into the **backend** folder:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2️⃣ Install all dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3️⃣ Create a **.env** file in the backend folder and add the following environment variables:  
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```
   ⚠️ **Replace** `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB URL (if using MongoDB Atlas, get it from your database dashboard).  
   ⚠️ **Replace** `your_jwt_secret_key` with a strong, random string for authentication security.  

4️⃣ Start the backend server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   If everything is correct, you should see:  
   ```bash
   Server running on port 5000
   Database connected successfully
   ```

---

## 🔹 **Step 3: Setup the Frontend (Client)**
1️⃣ Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend folder:  
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend/my-app
   ```

2️⃣ Install frontend dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3️⃣ Start the frontend development server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4️⃣ If everything is set up correctly, the React app should automatically open in your browser at:  
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## 🔹 **Step 4: Connect Frontend & Backend**
By default, the frontend is configured to communicate with the backend running on `http://localhost:5000`.  
If needed, update the API base URL inside `frontend/src/config.js`:  
```js
export const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```

---

## 🚀 **Final Step: Testing the Application**
Once both servers are running:  
🔹 Visit **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.  
🔹 Register a new user and test the voting process. ***(Note: We are currently using a sample NIC database for verification, so your NIC number may not be verified. This project is still under development. Once completed, we will expand our NIC database for full verification.)***
🔹 Open the **MongoDB database** to verify that users and votes are being stored correctly.  

---

## 🛠 **Troubleshooting**
❌ **Issue:** _Command not found: npm_  
✔️ **Solution:** Ensure **Node.js** is installed properly by running:  
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```  

❌ **Issue:** _MongoDB connection failed_  
✔️ **Solution:** Make sure MongoDB is **running** locally (`mongod`) or use **MongoDB Atlas** with the correct **connection string**.  

❌ **Issue:** _Backend server crashes_  
✔️ **Solution:** Check if all **environment variables** are correctly set in the `.env` file.
